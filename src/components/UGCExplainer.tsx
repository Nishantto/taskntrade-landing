          UGC (User-Generated Content) is content made by real people, not production houses.
          Think videos, photos, and reviews created by everyday users or creators talking about a product
          in their voice, on their terms. No fancy setups. Just authenticity that performs.

          This isn't influencer marketing. It's content marketing that converts, at scale.
